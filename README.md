# Linear Regression- Sales Prediction
A complete walk through of Linear Regression Project

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm. 
It shows a linear relationship between a dependent and one/more independent variables. It finds how the value of the dependent variable is changing according to the value of the independent variable.  
Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price etc.
Linear regression can be further divided into two types of the algorithm:
-	Simple Linear Regression: When single independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable.
-	Multiple Linear regression: When more than one independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable.
