# Linear Regression- Sales Prediction
A complete walk through of Linear Regression Project

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm. 
It shows a linear relationship between a dependent and one/more independent variables. It finds how the value of the dependent variable is changing according to the value of the independent variable.  
Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price etc.
Linear regression can be further divided into two types of the algorithm:
-	Simple Linear Regression: When single independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable.
-	Multiple Linear regression: When more than one independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable.

# Project
#### Business Problem - a company wants to increase its sells to a certain amount. Now the challenge is to find the amount of investment on advertisement that will result the gain in sales. 
To solve this problem, we have used historical data of investment and sales value and we have prepared our dataset.
Next we have created a Linear Regression model and fitted the dataset with the model. 
After testing the model, we have saved the model for future use. 
Finally, we have integrated the model with a GUI, in this project we will create a tkinter GUI.
